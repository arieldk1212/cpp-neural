// Creatinal Design, Provides an interface for creating objects in the 
// a superclass, but allows subclass to alter the type of objects that
// will be created.


/*
The factory method pattern is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
It provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
You need pointer or reference to a base class, and you also need a virtual factory method in the base class in order to call the correct instance methods of the object created by the factory method. This is Polymorphism.
The reason you need a pointer or a reference to a base class is because an object of derived class should be able to replace an object of a parent class.
In other words, wherever an object of a parent (base) class is expected, you can use an object of its derived class(es).
This is substitutability principle of inheritance (also known by Liskov Substitution principle). This allows for flexibility in usage.

The problem isnâ€™t necessarily with using if-else conditions per se. Rather, the issue arises from the need to understand how to create objects of the desired class without the assistance of the Factory Method pattern.
Without this pattern, if an object needs to be created at multiple points in your code, you would be required to repeat the same instantiation logic each time.
Furthermore, if the logic for object creation were to change (for example, if additional constructor arguments were required), you would need to update every instance where the object is instantiated.

When it is useful?
When you have a class that can have multiple subclasses, each providing a different implementation.
When you want to decouple the client code from the concrete classes being instantiated.
When you need to extend the application by adding new types of objects without modifying existing code.
